This project is a web application that allows users to view and favourite images of different cat breeds. 
It uses a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Axios for API interactions, with Bootstrap for styling and a carousel component.

Features
Breed Selection: Choose a cat breed from a dropdown menu to view a carousel of images for that breed.
Carousel: Display images in a responsive Bootstrap carousel with navigation controls.
Favourites: Click the heart icon on an image to toggle its status as a favourite.
Clicking on the heart(to favorite) will automatically take you to the favorites list to show the image you favorited.
If you would like to select another image from the same breed, you have to refresh the page.
The carousel is limited to show only 3 favorited images, so you have to unfavorite some from the list.
I added one favorited image in the favorites category, feel free to add 2 more favorites so you can verify it works.
